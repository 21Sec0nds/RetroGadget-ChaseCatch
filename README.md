# 🕹️ Simple Lua Chase/Catch Game Template

Basic template for a **Chase/Catch game** built using Lua. The game features a **player** (the chaser) who moves around the screen to **catch a target** (the caught). The game is simple and perfect, as it serves as a foundation for creating more complex 2D games.

> **Note:** You can use this template as a starting point for building your own Lua-based games or modify it to suit your needs.

> [!TIP]   
> If you don't want to go through the setup step by step, you can directly access the game from the Steam Workshop.
